evolution for multi?
stuti+lulu+jenny -> rob



a trait evolves with one can reuse



spawn the organims 
: give them a territory 
: define boundary?

dispatch their evolution on 
: different times 
: different conditions 

the evolution could be, 
-> gradual colour change 
-> gradual size change 
-> gradual territory movement
-> shape change 

the conditions could be
-> coming in contact with a specfic organism
-> coming in contact with a specific colour 
-> moving to a specific habitat 

Size: 
written as percentage of total space 

Habitat:
written as geo coords

Colour:

How do you do it all?


to clone use 
fn+LIKE
devise:



size:
growsat 
growsize 
growsto 

movement:
MOVE
angle
speed 

merge 


lulu:
size like 2*rob
distort lulu 


shape lulu

positions
distance and angle 

movement 
distance and angle 

size 
distance 

pattern 
and colour 

lulu:
mimic stuti 
pattern mimic stuti 
size mimic stuti 
movement mimic stuti*2




union 
subtract

Spawn organisms 
name them 
change their shape 


doing this ---> leads to this 


how to add colour 
how to distort shape 
how to make it move 
how does it fuse 

to add colour 
x 





Add threat errors 
add keep
add terminate 
add fate 

test growth 
add clone 
add background 

maintain global counter
fate 


add colour and distortion pick 
add keep function 


enable/disable functions based in global counter state?

state = [2,3,5]
spawn original organism 
{
    2    
}
{
    3
}
{
    5
}

0 is background or driver?
