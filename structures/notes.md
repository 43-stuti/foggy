spawn the organims 
: give them a territory 
: define boundary?

dispatch their evolution on 
: different times 
: different conditions 

the evolution could be, 
-> gradual colour change 
-> gradual size change 
-> gradual territory movement
-> shape change 

the conditions could be
-> coming in contact with a specfic organism
-> coming in contact with a specific colour 
-> moving to a specific habitat 

Size: 
written as percentage of total space 

Habitat:
written as geo coords

Colour:
start with primary
